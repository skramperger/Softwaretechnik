# Softwaretechnik

## Overview

This repository contains all the programs written for school, starting from the 3rd semester at HTL Bulme Graz-Gösting. The repository aims to represent the ongoing learning path for C programming throughout the entire learning period.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into several folders and files, each representing different semesters and topics:

### 3ABELI

This folder contains a variety of C and C++ programs created during the 3rd semester. The programs focus on fundamental programming concepts such as control structures, functions, arrays, and sensor interfacing with hardware components like LEDs and ultrasonic sensors. It includes laboratory exercises, practice programs, and test programs.

### 4ABELI

This folder includes C++ programs developed during the 4th semester. The focus is on advanced topics like digital port manipulation, analog-to-digital conversion, pin change interrupts, and file editing. The folder comprises exercises, test programs, and utility projects.

### 5ABELI

This folder features various C++ programs and projects from the 5th semester. Topics covered include advanced embedded systems programming with ARM architecture, interrupt handling, and RGB light control. It contains test preparation programs, embedded systems projects, and utility programs.

### 6ABELI

This folder consists of projects and programs developed during the 6th semester, emphasizing web-based games and practice projects for tests. It includes implementations of games like Snake and Ping Pong, as well as practice exercises for tests.

## Getting Started

To use the programs in this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repositoryname.git
   cd repositoryname
   ```

2. **Compile the programs**:
Use a C/C++ compiler like gcc for C files or g++ for C++ files. For example:
   ```bash
   gcc 1.Test.c -o test
   ./test
   ```

### Usage
Each program in the repository serves a different educational purpose. Refer to the comments within the code for specific usage instructions and details about what each program does.

### Example
To run the LED running light program:
   ```bash
   cd 3ABELI/Labor
   g++ led_running_light_millis.cpp -o led_running_light
   ./led_running_light
   ```
