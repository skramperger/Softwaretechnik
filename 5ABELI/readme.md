## 5ABELI

This folder contains various C++ programs and projects developed during the 5th semester at HTL Bulme Graz-GÃ¶sting. The focus during this semester includes advanced embedded systems programming with ARM architecture, interrupt handling, and RGB light control.

### Key Programs and Exercises:

- **Test and Preparation Programs**
  - `2. Test FSST rework.cpp`: Reworked test program for FSST.
  - `Test_Vorbereitung(5ACELI-Test).cpp`: Preparation program for the 5ACELI test.

- **Embedded Systems and Control Programs**
  - `Introduction_mbed.cpp`: An introductory program for the mbed platform, demonstrating basic functionalities.
  - `LED interrupt control.cpp`: Program to control an LED using interrupts.
  - `Ultraschall-Sensor-ARM.cpp`: Program interfacing with an ultrasonic sensor using ARM architecture.
  - `rgb_light_control.cpp`: Program for controlling RGB lights, demonstrating color mixing and control techniques.

- **Utility Programs**
  - `pointer_revision.cpp`: A program revising pointer concepts and their applications.

These programs are designed to deepen the understanding of embedded systems, particularly focusing on ARM-based development and practical applications involving sensors and RGB lighting.
