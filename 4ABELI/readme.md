## 4ABELI

This folder contains various C++ programs created during the 4th semester at HTL Bulme Graz-Gösting. These programs focus on advanced topics such as digital port manipulation, analog-to-digital conversion, pin change interrupts, and file editing.

### Key Programs and Exercises:

- **Exercises**
  - `02Übungen Digitaler Port mit P...cpp`: Exercises on digital port manipulation with preprocessor directives.
  - `02Übungen Digitaler Port.cpp`: Exercises on digital port manipulation.
  - `09ÜbungenADWandler.cpp`: Exercises on analog-to-digital conversion.
  - `10Übungen PinChangeInterrup...cpp`: Exercises on handling pin change interrupts.

- **Test Programs**
  - `1. Test.cpp`: 
  - `2. Test.cpp`: 

- **Project and Utility Programs**
  - `PortManipulation.cpp`: Program demonstrating various techniques for port manipulation.
  - `file_editing.cpp`: Program for editing files, demonstrating file handling techniques in C++.
  - `interupts.cpp`: Program dealing with interrupts, showcasing the implementation and handling of interrupt service routines.

These programs build on the foundational concepts learned in previous semesters and introduce more complex topics essential for advanced embedded systems programming.
