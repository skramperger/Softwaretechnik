### Labor

This folder contains practical C++ programs developed as part of the laboratory exercises. These programs focus on controlling LEDs and interfacing with ultrasonic sensors, providing hands-on experience with hardware programming and real-time systems.

### Key Programs:

- **led_control.cpp**: Program to control the state of an LED (on/off) through code.
- **led_running_light.cpp**: Implementation of a running light effect using multiple LEDs.
- **led_running_light_millis.cpp**: Similar to `led_running_light.cpp`, but utilizes the `millis` function to manage timing for the running light effect.
- **ultraschall_sensor.cpp**: Program to interface with an ultrasonic sensor, reading distance measurements and possibly triggering actions based on the sensor input.

These programs are essential for understanding the basics of hardware control and sensor integration in embedded systems.
