## 3ABELI

This folder contains a variety of C and C++ programs created during the 3rd semester at HTL Bulme Graz-Gösting. The programs cover fundamental concepts of programming, such as control structures, functions, arrays, and sensor interfacing with hardware components like LEDs and ultrasonic sensors.

### Key Programs and Exercises:

- **Labor**
  - `led_control.cpp`: Controls an LED.
  - `led_running_light.cpp`: Implements a running light using LEDs.
  - `led_running_light_millis.cpp`: Controls a running light using the `millis` function for timing.
  - `ultraschall_sensor.cpp`: Interfaces with an ultrasonic sensor to read distance measurements.

- **Exercises**
  - `02und03Übungen.c`: Basic programming exercises covering control structures.
  - `04ÜbungenSchleifen.c`: Exercises focusing on loops.
  - `05ÜbungenSchleifen&Felder.c`: Exercises on loops and arrays.
  - `06ÜbungenFunktionen.c`: Exercises related to functions.
  - `07ÜbungenFunktionen2.c`: Additional exercises on functions.
  - `08ÜbungenFelderFunktionen.c`: Exercises combining arrays and functions.

- **Test and Practice Programs**
  - `1. Test.c`: Initial test program.
  - `2. Test.c`: Another test program with different logic.
  - `Felder.c`: Demonstrates array usage.
  - `Funktionen mit Präprozessoren.c`: Utilizes preprocessor directives with functions.
  - `Quersumme.c`: Calculates the cross sum of a number.
  - `Rekursion.c`: Demonstrates recursion.
  - `pointer.c`: Explores pointer usage.
  - `strings.c`: Handles string operations.

These programs serve as practical exercises and projects to reinforce the understanding of programming concepts and hardware interfacing, forming a crucial part of the curriculum.
